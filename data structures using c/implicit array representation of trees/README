Implicit Array representation of binary trees.
For almost complete binary trees the nodes can be numbered from 1 to n so that the number assigned to the left son is twice that of the root
and the right son is 1 more than twice the root. 
The sequential representation will save storage space for trees that are almost complete, since it eliminates the need for left, right and father. 
Linked representation allows for a more flexible use of a collection of nodes only limited by the available memory. 
Inorder traversal is ascending order the tree is a binary tree
