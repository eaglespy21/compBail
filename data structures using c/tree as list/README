Binary tree to find duplicates in an array 
/*As show in data structures using C by Aaron M. Tenenbaum et al. 
Linked represention or dynamic node representation of binary tree used. 
Father field is not used. 
Inorder, preorder and postorder travesal using recursion. 
Recursion for traversal is faster than non-recursive stacking/un stacking because - 
1. there is no extra recursion like in fibonacci numbers 
2. recrusion stack cannot be entirely eliminated like in factorial, therefore built in recursion is more efficient 
3. No extraneous paramters and local variables.
