Something is wrong with the new inside the for loop. Everytime there is a new, there should be a delete and that's a rule. But not getting any valgrind errors which makes it even weirder because I don't know what's happening. The structure of the program is also not right. 

Positives - Make file works, linked list insertion works in some capacity.
