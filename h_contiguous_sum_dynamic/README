Using arrays, initialize double dimensional arrays. 
Successfull implementation of knapsack problem. But this is not the solution to this particular problem. 
This problem required continguous sum. Knapsack gives us non - contiguous sum which is the same as adding all the positive elements in this problem, LOL.
