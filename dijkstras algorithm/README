Dijkstra's Algorithm 
/*Help from Geeks for Geeks*/

Different from prims in ways that it doesn't only calculate the minimum spanning tree but the shortest distance 
to each vertex from the source vertex. 

Source vertex is hardcoded to 0 
Multiple test cases won't work 
Time complexity is O(v^2). 
If adjacency lists are used then time complexity can be reduced to O(E log V)

The main time consumption is building the graph, since adjacency lists insertion is O(1), they are more efficient than arrays.
