Yield is like a return but it is used for generators and not iterables. 
It calculates the ith value and forgets about it. Each iteration is run just one. 
The iterative solution is actually the dynamic programming solution, as you build it bottom up. 
The recursive solution is top - down and unless memorized recursion is used its complexity is O(2^n) 
For dynamic solution and memorized recursion its O(n), space is O(n) or O(2) if you only store two values
