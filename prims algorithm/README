Prim's algorithm (main2.cpp) 
Using map to represent vertice and key, adjacency matrix.  
O(n^2) time complexity 
Used gdb to backtrace and find segmentation faults.

Problems  - doesn't work for multiple test cases
TODO - prim's algorithm using adjacency list to represent input graph. Time complexity is O(E log V) with binary heap
